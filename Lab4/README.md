# Lab 4 Web Mapping
### Daniel Kim

The overal effect I was looking for was a color full map that showed a representation of all the locations of the Sam's clubs to be removed in the United states.

Unfortunatley, because I used the colors of the Sam's club logo, the map itself does not look very appealing and seems to be more artsy then informative.
It could be improved if I make the icons pop out more and have all of the other background colors become lighter it would be much better visually.
